## My process

I started to build the ui as close to challenge standards using react and tailwindcss and then added basic functionality (add, remove, toggle ... of todos) using zustand.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](http://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React Beutiful DND](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - For Drag&Drop Support
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - State management

### Continued development

I will work on DND later.
